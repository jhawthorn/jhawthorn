<h3 align="center">👋 Hi! I'm John Hawthorn</h3>


I'm a staff software engineer on the Ruby Architecture team here at [GitHub :octocat:](https://github.com/github).

I'm a [💎 Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby) committer and on the [🚋 Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) core team. I like to spend as much time as possible working on performance. Hopefully I've made your code run faster too 🤗 

<br/>

<h4>A few Ruby projects I've made:</h4>

* [📏 `vernier`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/vernier) is a next-generation Ruby profiler
* [🏎️ `rapidjson`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/rapidjson-ruby) is a fast JSON parser/serializer (based on the C++ RapidJSON library)
* [🗑 `discard`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/discard) provides a simple soft-delete pattern for ActiveRecord.
* [🏗️ `actionview_precompiler`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/actionview_precompiler) eager loads view templates at boot (really this should be upstreamed into Rails)
* [🐑 `sheap`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/dkim) is a tool to analyze Ruby heaps
* [🍔`pub_grub`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/pub_grub) is a Ruby port of Natalie Weizenbaum's PubGrub CDCL-based version solving algorithm, as used by bundler
* [📧`dkim`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/dkim) is a Ruby implementation of email DKIM signiatures

<br/>

<h4>Some of my non-ruby open source projects:</h4>

* [🔍 `fzy`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy) is a fast and simple fuzzy text finder for the terminal. I wote fzy wanting a faster and more consistent algorithm than was available at the time, other tools have since adopted my algorithm. Fun fact: If you press `t` to find files in a GitHub repo that's fzy!
* [🖼️ `meh`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/meh/) is a fast image viewer for X11 using raw XLib.

<h4>I dabble in electronics ⚡:</h4>

⌨️ I designed a [USB controller to modernize Model M keyboards](https://www.johnhawthorn.com/2020/07/modelh-keyboard-controller/).

⌨️ I [hand wired an ergodox-style keyboard](https://www.johnhawthorn.com/2020/05/building-a-homemade-keyboard/)

☕ I [built an MQTT-enabled temperature controller for my espresso machine](https://github.com/jhawthorn/espresso)
