<h3 align="center">👋 Hi! I'm John Hawthorn</h3>


I'm a staff software engineer on the Ruby Architecture team here at [GitHub :octocat:](https://github.com/github).

I'm a [💎 Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby) committer and on the [🚋 Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) core team. I most like working on performance, hopefully I've made your code run faster too 🤗 

<br/>

<h4>Some of my open source projects:</h4>

🔍 [`fzy`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy) is a fast and simple fuzzy text finder for the terminal. I wote fzy wanting a faster and more consistent algorithm than was available at the time, other tools have since adopted my algorithm. Fun fact: If you press `t` to find files in a GitHub repo that's fzy!

🗑 [`discard`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/discard) provides a simple soft-delete pattern for ActiveRecord.

🖼️ [`meh`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/meh/) is a fast image viewer for X11 using raw XLib.

⌨️ I [hand wired an ergodox-style keyboard](https://www.johnhawthorn.com/2020/05/building-a-homemade-keyboard/)
